# Python-HDB_Flat_Resale_Price_Analysis
As part of the Career Foundry Data Analytics Program, this [project](01%20Project%20Management/A6_Data_Project_Brief.pdf) is aimed to build an interactive dashboard that will visually showcase well-curated results of an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python. 

## Background
The Housing and Development Board (HDB) is Singaporeâ€™s public housing authority, responsible for developing affordable, high-quality homes. Compared to Build-To-Order (BTO) flats, resale flats offer immediate availability, a variety of locations with established amenities, and greater flexibility in terms of unit type. However, a significant challenge is the rising prices in the resale market, which can be considerably higher than new BTO flats and may limit affordability for some buyers. 

## Objective
To study the factors that could affect the resale price of the HDB flats based on the data available. 

## Business Questions
1) Which factors below would affect the resale price of the resale flats?
   - floor area (sqm), remaining lease, distance to nearest train station (m), storey range midpoint
2) For the categorical variables below, which categories have higher resale price?
   - flat type, flat model, interchange flag (whether if the nearest train station is an interchange)
3) How does the resale price differ geographically?
   - town, region
4) How does the resale price change over time?
